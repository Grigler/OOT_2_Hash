# Hash-Table Spatial Partitioning - With SQLite3 Analytics

Simple implementation of 2D physical collisions between particles, implemented using the SDL2 graphics API, with a hash-table implementation of spatial partitioning

A custom C++ wrapper for SQLite3 is also included, allowing for profiling data to be stored and analysed between simulations
